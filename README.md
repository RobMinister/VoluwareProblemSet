# Voluware Full Stack Engineer Problem Set

This project lays out the design for a lightweight inventory and alerting system tailored for a department store with multiple sections like Clothing, Home Goods, Jewelry, and more. It includes a clean MySQL schema for tracking inventory, a set of API routes built with Flask-style Python and a high-level overview of how alerts would be handled when stock runs low. Core assumptions and design decisions are also documented for clarity.
